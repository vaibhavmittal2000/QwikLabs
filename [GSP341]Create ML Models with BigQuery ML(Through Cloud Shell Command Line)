Create ML Models with BigQuery ML: Challenge Lab:

Task 1: Create a dataset to store your machine learning models

It can be called any name to pass the test but for the remaining instructions to work use `austin` as the dataset name.


bq mk austin

Task 2: Create a forecasting BigQuery machine learning model.

Cloud Shell
export PROJECT_ID=DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID


bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL austin.austin_1 OPTIONS(input_label_cols=['duration_minutes'], model_type='linear_reg') AS SELECT duration_minutes, location, start_station_name, CAST(EXTRACT(dayofweek FROM start_time) AS STRING) as dayofweek, CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday, FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` AS trips JOIN \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations\` AS stations ON trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id WHERE EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2018"

## Task 3: Create the second machine learning model. 

 
Cloud Shell
export PROJECT_ID=DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID


bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL austin.austin_2 OPTIONS(input_label_cols=['duration_minutes'], model_type='linear_reg') AS SELECT duration_minutes, subscriber_type, start_station_name, CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` AS trips WHERE EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2018"

Task 4: Evaluate the two machine learning models.


Cloud Shell\


bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "SELECT SQRT(mean_squared_error)AS rmse, mean_absolute_error FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL austin.austin_1, (SELECT duration_minutes, location, start_station_name, CAST(EXTRACT(dayofweek FROM start_time) AS STRING) as dayofweek, CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday, FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` AS trips JOIN \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations\` AS stations ON trips.start_station_id = stations.station_id WHERE EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2019))"


bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "SELECT SQRT(mean_squared_error)AS rmse, mean_absolute_error FROM ML.EVALUATE(MODEL austin.austin_2, (SELECT duration_minutes, subscriber_type, start_station_name, CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` AS trips WHERE EXTRACT(year from start_time) = 2019))"

Task 5: Use the subscriber type machine learning model to predict average trip durations

Cloud Shell

bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "SELECT start_station_name, avg(duration_minutes) as avg_duration, count(*) as total_trips FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` WHERE EXTRACT(year FROM start_time) = 2019 GROUP BY start_station_name ORDER BY total_trips DESC"
bq query --use_legacy_sql=false "SELECT   avg(predicted_duration_minutes),count(duration_minutes) FROM Ml.PREDICT(MODEL austin.austin_2, (SELECT duration_minutes, subscriber_type, start_station_name,  CAST(EXTRACT(hour FROM start_time) AS STRING) AS hourofday FROM \`bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_trips\` AS trips WHERE EXTRACT(year from start_time)=2019 and start_station_name = '21st & Speedway @PCL' and subscriber_type='Single Trip' ))"
